      <description>Since I got back from #rstudioconf, I’ve started to warm up to the idea of sharing my code, even if it isn’t perfect. There may be typos, the blog post may be short, but sharing my work is beneficial for the greater #rstats community, and supports open-source data science.
So this belated post is inspired by Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot, in which the NY Times examines residential zoning patterns in different cities.</description>
