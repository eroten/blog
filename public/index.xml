      <description>I decided to get a little wild with my Sunday, so I wrote a tiny R package! I also submitted it to CRAN. Its my first time submitting to CRAN, but I’m feeling hopeful!
{twohundredfiftythings} is a tiny R package that allows the user to access Michael Sorkin’s list of things an architect should know. The list was originally published in “What Goes Up: The Rights and Wrongs to a City”.</description>

      <description>I am a knitter. Knitting is a calming, fulfilling practice that keep my hands busy and require just enough brain power to keep my mind from wandering too far. Over the past winter, I conquered my fear of making socks, and now I profess that I am a sock knitter. I made socks for Christmas gifts, and churned out four pairs during my evenings, bus commutes, long work meetings, lectures, coffee and tea shop visits (basically everywhere).</description>

      <description>Since I got back from #rstudioconf, I’ve started to warm up to the idea of sharing my code, even if it isn’t perfect. There may be typos, the blog post may be short, but sharing my work is beneficial for the greater #rstats community, and supports open-source data science.
So this belated post is inspired by Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot, in which the NY Times examines residential zoning patterns in different cities.</description>

      <description>BackgroundPrepData cleaningExplore geological ages and formationsWisconsin glaciationContext and inset mapFinishing upNotesData citationBackgroundThose of us even mildly obsessed with maps will be familiar with Harold Fisk’s 1944 series documenting the historic travel of the Mississippi River in Mississippi River Alluvial Valley. In my house in college, filled with geography majors and map enthusiasts, we had a small print hung on the wall, and it was easy to start reading it, and end up standing there, just staring, for quite a while.</description>
