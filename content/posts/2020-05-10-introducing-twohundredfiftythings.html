<p>I decided to get a little wild with my Sunday, so I wrote a tiny R package! I also submitted it to CRAN. Its my first time submitting to CRAN, but I’m feeling hopeful!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eroten/twohundredfiftythings"><code>{twohundredfiftythings}</code></a> is a tiny R package that allows the user to access Michael Sorkin’s list of things an architect should know. The list was originally published in “What Goes Up: The Rights and Wrongs to a City”.</p>
<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I was inspired to make this package after listening to <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible’s</a> 400th episode: <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-smell-of-concrete-after-rain/">“The Smell of Concrete After Rain”</a>. Hearing Roman Mars read through a small selection of these things, I decided to read the entire list. I figured it would be nice to read one of these every once in a while, so I made this package to return a random “thing” from the list.</p>
<p>I was also inspired by my dear friend Katie Jolly’s R package, <a href="https://github.com/katiejolly/advicegiveR"><code>{advicegiveR}</code></a>. Katie introduced me to 99pi, and I am forever grateful.</p>
